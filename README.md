# AtmoLogger
ESP-01 + BME280 humidity / temperature / barometric pressure logger

Use provided wiring.

Logs humidity / temperature / barometric pressure:
- Two last hours
- Last day
- Last week
- Last month

The ESP creates a wifi network with a captive portal which is redirecting on a page with charts.

This is a 3 hours project. Obviously this would need a big cleaning (this readme should be cleaned too).

Charts are created using https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot. Amazing work there!
